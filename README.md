I'm a MERN Stack developer passionate about building modern, scalable web applications.
I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, and enjoy writing clean, efficient code.
I work across the full stack â€” from creating responsive React interfaces to building secure Express APIs.
Always exploring new technologies and best practices to improve performance and user experience.
Currently focused on building real-world projects to strengthen my skills.
